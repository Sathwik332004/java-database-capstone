## MySQL Database Design

This Section defines the MongoDB schema for storing **prescriptions**, which complements the MySQL relational schema used for appointments, doctors, and patients. Since prescriptions often involve unstructured and evolving data like medications, notes, and dosage schedules, MongoDB is a natural fit.

### Table: patients

- id: INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment  
  *â†’ Uniquely identifies each patient*  
- full_name: VARCHAR(100), Not Null  
  *â†’ Patientâ€™s name*

---

### Table: appointments

- id: INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment  
  *â†’ Unique appointment ID*  
- doctor_id: INT, Foreign Key â†’ doctors(id)  
  *â†’ Links appointment to a doctor*  
- patient_id: INT, Foreign Key â†’ patients(id)  
  *â†’ Links appointment to a patient*  
- appointment_time: DATETIME, Not Null  
  *â†’ When the appointment takes place*  
- duration_minutes: INT, Default 60  
  *â†’ Default to 1-hour appointments*  
- reason: TEXT  
  *â†’ Reason for consultation (optional)*  
- status: INT, Default 0  
  *â†’ 0 = Scheduled, 1 = Completed, 2 = Cancelled*  
- created_at: TIMESTAMP, Default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
  *â†’ Tracks when appointment was booked*  

**Constraints:**  
- ON DELETE CASCADE for both doctor and patient  
  *â†’ Deletes appointment if doctor/patient is removed*  
- Doctorâ€™s schedule overlap must be prevented by backend logic  
  *â†’ Schema won't block overlaps, enforce it via code*

### Table: payments

- id: INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment  
  *â†’ Unique transaction ID*  
- appointment_id: INT, Foreign Key â†’ appointments(id), Not Null  
  *â†’ Each payment is tied to one appointment*  
- patient_id: INT, Foreign Key â†’ patients(id), Not Null  
  *â†’ Helps retrieve payment history by patient*  
- amount: DECIMAL(10,2), Not Null  
  *â†’ Total amount paid (e.g., â‚¹1200.00)*  
- payment_method: ENUM('CARD', 'UPI', 'CASH', 'INSURANCE'), Not Null

  *â†’ Tracks payment success or failure*  
- payment_date: DATETIME, Default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
  *â†’ Timestamp of payment completion*

**Constraints:**  
- ON DELETE CASCADE for `appointment_id` and `patient_id`  
- Optional: add transaction ID, refund tracking later

---

### Table: admins

  *â†’ Encrypted (BCrypt) password for login*  
- created_at: TIMESTAMP, Default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
  *â†’ Tracks admin creation*

**Notes:**  
- Only a few users have admin privileges  
- Use JWT tokens for admin sessions

---

### Table: clinic_locations (Optional)

- id: INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment  
  *â†’ Unique clinic location*  
- name: VARCHAR(100), Not Null  
  *â†’ Clinic name (e.g., SmartCare - Main Branch)*  
- address: TEXT, Not Null  
  *â†’ Street, city, zip*  
- city: VARCHAR(50), Not Null  
  *â†’ Search filter*  
- state: VARCHAR(50), Not Null  
  *â†’ Regional info*  
- phone: VARCHAR(15)  
  *â†’ Branch-specific contact info*

## âœ… Design Justifications

- **Normalization:** Patients, Doctors, Admins are separated due to role-based data and authentication needs.
- **Flexible Appointments:** Status + duration + timestamps allow analytics and scheduling flexibility.
- **Referential Integrity:** All relationships use foreign keys with `ON DELETE CASCADE` to avoid orphaned records.
- **Email & Phone Formats:** To be validated in code using regex and annotations (`@Email`, `@Pattern`).
- **Prescriptions:** Stored in MongoDB for flexibility â€” can include dynamic fields and nested arrays.
- **Unavailability:** Can be added later as a new table to prevent bookings during blocked time slots.

## MongoDB Schema Design â€“ Smart Clinic Management System

This Section defines the MongoDB schema for storing **prescriptions**, which complements the MySQL relational schema used for appointments, doctors, and patients. Since prescriptions often involve unstructured and evolving data like medications, notes, and dosage schedules, MongoDB is a natural fit.

### ðŸ“Œ Collection: prescriptions

Each document represents a **prescription issued by a doctor during an appointment**. The structure is flexible and supports nested objects, metadata, and evolving fields.

#### ðŸ§¾ Example Document

```json

  "_id": ObjectId("64c9b2e8fcf4d8a7a5e83099"),
  "appointment_id": 103,                       // Links to appointment in MySQL
  "patient_id": 12,                            // ID from MySQL patients table
  "doctor_id": 5,                              // ID from MySQL doctors table
  "issued_on": "2025-07-27T10:30:00Z",         // Prescription issue time (ISO 8601)
